The scent of old paper and woodsmoke greets you before you even step through the heavy wooden doors. Inside Leakey's Bookshop, the world outside melts away, replaced by a hushed reverence for the written word. Housed in a former Gaelic church, the space soars upwards, with stained-glass windows casting a kaleidoscope of colours onto towering shelves of books. A gentle warmth radiates from the wood-burning stove at the heart of the shop, inviting you to linger. This is not merely a place to buy books; it is a sanctuary, a treasure trove, a living museum of stories waiting to be rediscovered. Every corner holds a new discovery, every creaking floorboard whispers a tale. Welcome to Leakey's, where time slows down, and the magic of literature is palpable in the pages feels wonderfully, and the magic of literature comes to get lost in the magic of the magic of the magic of the written word.
