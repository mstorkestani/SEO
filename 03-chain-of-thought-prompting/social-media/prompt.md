I need a social media post for Leakey's Bookshop. Let's think step-by-step:

1.  **Define the Goal:** What is the primary objective of this post?
2.  **Identify the Target Audience:** Who are we trying to reach?
3.  **Choose the Key Message:** What is the single most important thing we want to communicate?
4.  **Craft the Post:** Write the post, including a hook, the key message, and a call-to-action.
5.  **Select Hashtags:** Choose relevant hashtags to increase reach a list of relevant hashtags.
