I need a content brief for a blog post about Leakey's Bookshop. Let's think step-by-step:

1.  **Analyze Search Intent:** First, describe the likely user persona for the query "best bookshops in Scotland with character." What are they *really* looking for?
2.  **Suggest Titles:** Second, create 3 compelling, SEO-friendly titles for the blog post.
3.  **Create an Outline:** Third, structure the blog post with an introduction, 3-4 main body sections, and a conclusion.
4.  **Suggest a Call-to-Action (CTA):** Finally, suggest a clear CTA to encourage readers to visit.
