I need a keyword strategy for Leakey's Bookshop. Let's think step-by-step:

1.  **Identify the core audiences:** Who are the main customer segments for the bookshop?
2.  **Brainstorm keywords for each audience:** What would each segment search for?
3.  **Categorize the keywords:** Group them into logical categories (e.g., by intent, location, product).
4.  **Present the final list:** Show the keywords in a structured format.
