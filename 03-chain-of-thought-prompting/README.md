# 03: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

**Definition:** Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique where you explicitly ask the LLM to "think step-by-step" before providing the final answer. This encourages the model to reason through the problem logically, breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts. The result is a more thoughtful, comprehensive, and often more accurate output.

**Analogy:** It’s like asking a team member not just for the final report, but to also show you their research, their analysis, and their conclusions in a clear, sequential order.

## When to Use CoT Prompting

*   **Complex Problem-Solving:** When the task requires multiple steps of reasoning (e.g., market analysis, strategic planning).
*   **Creative Ideation:** To guide the AI through a creative process, from brainstorming to a fully-fledged concept.
*   **Improving Transparency:** To understand *how* the AI arrived at its conclusion, making the output more trustworthy and easier to evaluate.

## Key Characteristics

*   **Explicit Instruction:** The prompt includes a clear instruction like "think step-by-step" or "let's think step-by-step."
*   **Sequential Reasoning:** The model first outputs its reasoning process, then the final answer.
*   **Improved Accuracy:** By breaking down the problem, the model is less likely to make logical errors.
