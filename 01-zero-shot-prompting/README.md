# 01: Zero-Shot Prompting

**Definition:** Zero-shot prompting is the most basic form of interaction with a Large Language Model (LLM). It involves asking a question or giving a command without providing any prior examples or context. The model is expected to understand and respond based solely on its pre-existing training data.

**Analogy:** It’s like asking a new team member, “Can you write a social media post?” without giving them any information about the brand, the tone of voice, or examples of previous posts.

## When to Use Zero-Shot Prompting

*   **Simple, Factual Queries:** When you need a quick, straightforward answer (e.g., “What is the capital of Scotland?”).
*   **Quick Brainstorming:** For generating a wide range of initial ideas without any constraints.
*   **Establishing a Baseline:** It’s the perfect starting point to see what an unguided LLM produces. You can then use more advanced techniques to refine the output.

## Key Characteristics

*   **No Examples:** The prompt does not contain any examples of the desired output.
*   **High Variability:** The quality and format of the output can be inconsistent.
*   **Relies on Pre-training:** The model’s ability to answer depends entirely on the knowledge it was trained on.

## Examples in This Section

In this section, you will see how zero-shot prompting performs on various marketing tasks for our case study, Leakey’s Bookshop. Notice how the outputs are often generic and lack the specific character of the brand. This is the “before” state that we will dramatically improve upon with more advanced techniques.

### Tasks Covered:

1.  **Keyword Research:** Generating a list of keywords.
2.  **Content Creation:** Coming up with a blog post idea.
3.  **Social Media:** Writing a Google Business Profile post.
