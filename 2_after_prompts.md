## The Advanced Prompting Workflow

### Prompt 1: The Keyword Strategy (Using the 6-Part Structure)

This foundational prompt uses a detailed structure to ensure a strategic, GEO-optimized keyword list based on the real business.

```
**1. ROLE:** You are an expert SEO strategist specializing in local retail and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). Your client is Leakey's Bookshop, a real independent bookstore in Inverness, Scotland.

**2. TASK:** Generate a strategic keyword list of 10 high-impact keywords.

**3. CONTEXT:** Leakey's Bookshop is Scotland's largest secondhand bookshop, housed in a former Gaelic church. It specializes in secondhand and antiquarian books, maps, and prints. The store features over 100,000 books, a wood-burning stove, and a unique atmospheric reading experience. It has been operating since 1979. The goal is to attract both locals and tourists by ranking in AI-powered answer engines for queries related to the bookstore's unique offerings and atmosphere.

**4. CONSTRAINTS:** The list must include a mix of broad "head" terms and specific, long-tail "niche" terms. Focus on what makes Leakey's unique (the church setting, the atmosphere, the rare books, the history).

**5. EVALUATION CRITERIA:** The list will be judged on its relevance to the bookstore's unique offerings and its potential to attract high-intent customers.

**6. OUTPUT FORMAT:** Present the output in a Markdown table with columns for 'Keyword', 'Keyword Type' (Head/Niche), and 'Primary Target Audience' (Local/Tourist).

### Prompt 2: The Content Idea (Using Chain-of-Thought)

This prompt uses the output from Prompt 1 and applies CoT to develop a creative, strategic content brief.

```
Excellent, that keyword list is a great start. Now, let's focus on a keyword that captures the unique atmosphere of Leakey's, such as **‘best bookshops in Scotland with character’**.

I need you to develop a comprehensive content brief for a blog post targeting this keyword. Let's think step-by-step:

1.  **Analyze Search Intent:** First, describe the likely user persona for this query. What are they *really* looking for?
2.  **Suggest Titles:** Second, create 3 compelling, SEO-friendly titles for the blog post.
3.  **Create an Outline:** Third, structure the blog post with an introduction, 3-4 main body sections, and a conclusion.
4.  **Suggest a Call-to-Action (CTA):** Finally, suggest a clear CTA to encourage readers to visit.
```

### Prompt 3: The GBP Post (Using a Strong Persona)

This final prompt uses a specific persona to create an engaging, action-oriented post.

```
You are the social media manager for Leakey's Bookshop, and you have a warm, literary, slightly quirky tone of voice. Your goal is to drive foot traffic this upcoming weekend.

Write a compelling Google Business Profile post (under 1500 characters) that captures the essence of Leakey's unique atmosphere. The post must:
- Evoke the feeling of stepping into a literary sanctuary with character and history.
- Mention the unique architectural features (the church, stained-glass windows, the wood-burning stove).
- Highlight the vast collection and the treasure-hunt experience of browsing.
- Include a clear, friendly call-to-action to visit this weekend.
- Add 3-4 relevant local hashtags (e.g., #Inverness, #ScottishHighlands, #IndieBookshop, #LiteraryTreasure).
