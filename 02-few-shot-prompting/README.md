# 02: Few-Shot Prompting

**Definition:** Few-shot prompting is a technique where you provide the LLM with a small number of examples ("shots") of the desired output format and content. This helps the model understand the task better and produce more consistent and accurate results.

**Analogy:** It’s like telling a new team member, “Here are three examples of our best-performing social media posts. Can you write a new one in a similar style?”

## When to Use Few-Shot Prompting

*   **When You Need a Specific Format:** If you need the output to follow a particular structure (e.g., a list, a table, a specific heading format), providing examples is highly effective.
*   **When You Need a Specific Tone of Voice:** By showing the AI examples of the desired tone, you can guide it to write in a way that is consistent with your brand.
*   **When the Task is Complex:** For tasks that are not straightforward, providing a few examples can clarify your expectations and improve the quality of the output.

## Key Characteristics

*   **Includes Examples:** The prompt contains one or more examples of the desired output.
*   **Improves Consistency:** The model is more likely to produce outputs that match the style and format of the examples.
*   **Reduces Ambiguity:** The examples clarify what you mean by “good” or “correct.”
