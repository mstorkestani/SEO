I need a social media post for Leakey's Bookshop. Here's an example of the kind of post I'm looking for:

"Step into a literary sanctuary where history meets discovery. 📚✨ For 45 years, Leakey's has been Scotland's beloved bookshop—housed in a former church with soaring stained-glass windows, a crackling wood-burning stove, and over 100,000 books waiting to be explored. This weekend, come experience the magic of Leakey's. Church Street, Inverness. #Inverness #ScottishHighlands #IndieBookshop #LiteraryTreasure"

Now, write another social media post in a similar style.
